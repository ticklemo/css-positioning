  <div class="block absolute">
    <h4>Absolute</h4>
    <p>I am positioned to the viewport or window. I am pulled from the document and can be sent anywhere on the screen using extra properties. I will go on top of other elements unless I have a lower z-index, it is fixed or there is another absolute later in the cascade. I do not stick to my position on scroll.</p>

  <div class="block fixed">
    <h4>Fixed Positioning </h4>
    <p>I am fixed even if you scroll, I am positioned relative to the viewport or window. I will go on top of other elements unless I have a lower z-index or there is another fixed later in the cascade. I stick to my position and will stay on the screen even when you scroll. </p>

  <div class="block relative">
    <h4>Relative Positioning</h4>
    <p>I am positioned relative to where I am usually placed. I do not get pulled from the flow of the document, but am still able to be moved using properties (top, right, bottom, left).</p>
